# Non linear equations solver 
## Caution! this web application is deliberately vulnerable, DO NOT use it in a production server.

### Introduction

Non-linear equations are ubiquitous in many fields, including physics, engineering, finance, and machine learning. However, in most cases, there is no analytical solution for these equations, and one has to resort to numerical methods to find the root.

This repository contains Python implementations of some of the popular numerical methods to solve non-linear equations, including:

- Fixed Point Method
- Bisection Method
- False Position Method
- Newton Raphson Method

Each method is implemented as a function inside the solver class. 
The repository also will be updates soon with more details about this webapp, or hacking challenge ;) .

Have a great day
